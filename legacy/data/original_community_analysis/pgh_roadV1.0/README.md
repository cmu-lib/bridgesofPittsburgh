I have created a folder called 'pgh_roadV1.0'. There are three parts in this folder<br>

- **edges.ipynb**  
This is a python code file. The code is my first attempt to call OpenStreetMapâ€™s Overpass API by using OSMnx python package. There are two output files. One is 'pgh_road', a folder which contains shapefiles of edges and nodes. The other is 'pgh_road.graphml', which is a graphml file used for Gephi.<br>

- **pgh_road**  
There are two folders inside. One is edge, the other is node. This is a output folder produced by python code. This folder contains shapefile of old edge data and node data that is downloaded by OSMnx python package.  This folder is duplicated in the folder 'pgh_roads_by_neighborhoods' as its data is necessary for the QGIS file there.<br>

- **pgh_road.graphml**  
This is the output file that python code produced.<br>

Here is the link of the OSMnx package I use.   [OSMnx Example](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/01-overview-osmnx.ipynb) <br>
