- **pgh_roadV1.0** <br>
This folder are files including our first attempt result of creating nodes and edges. (See details in pgh_roadV1.0 folder)

Gephi files pgh_road.gephi and connected-component.gephi were generated to examine the network structure created from those nodes and edges.

Images exported from the gephi file are in gephi_images

Tables exported from the gephi file are in pgh_road-tables

The pgh_roads_by_neighborhood includes files associated with transforming the network into GIS-readable files
