- **original_community_analysis** <br>
This folder contains files related to our first attempt to analyse the network structure of Pittsburgh roads/bridges. (See more details in pgh_roadV1.0 folder)

Gephi files pgh_road.gephi and connected-component.gephi were generated to examine the network structure created from those nodes and edges.

Tables exported from the gephi file are in pgh_road-tables

The pgh_roads_by_neighborhood includes files associated with transforming the network into GIS-readable files
