I have created a folder called 'pgh_roadV1.0'. There are three parts in this folder<br>

- **edges.ipynb**  
This is a python code file. The code is my first attempt to call OpenStreetMap’s Overpass API by using OSMnx python package. There are two output files. One is 'pgh_road', a folder which contains shapefiles of edges and nodes. The other is 'pgh_road.graphml', which is a graphml file used for Gephi.<br>

- **pgh_road**  
There are two folders inside. One is edge, the other is node. This is a output folder produced by python code. This folder contains shapefile of old edge data and node data that is downloaded by OSMnx python package.<br>

- **pgh_road.graphml**  
This is the output file that python code produced.<br>

Here is the link of the OSMnx package I use.   [OSMnx Example](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/01-overview-osmnx.ipynb) <br>
